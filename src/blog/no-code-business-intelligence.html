  No Code & BI: How AI is Shaping Business Intelligence
</h1><p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8" data-nbsp="true">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">Businesses need data insights to drive growth. While relevant data might be available, the technical expertise required to transform it into meaningful insights is often a challenge. This is where no code solutions for business intelligence (BI) come in; they empower non-technical colleagues to get insights from data without the need to write code.</p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">According to Gartner, <a href="https://visionpoint.systems/statistic/by-2025-low-code-or-no-code-system-will-be-used-to-develop-70-of-businesses-application/" class="text-indigo-600">the number of people using no code tools has been experiencing double-digit growth</a> year-on-year since 2021, showing mass adoption by large corporations and small businesses. This trend demonstrates no code solutions' ability to improve efficiency, reduce turnaround time for generating insights, and reduce the workload of in-house analysts.</p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">This article discusses the role of no code in business intelligence, as well as its benefits and applications across various departments and industries.</p>
<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8" data-nbsp="true">&nbsp;</p><h2
  class="mt-16 mb-4 text-4xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-3xl"
>
  The No Code Movement & its Benefits
</h2>
<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">James Martin, an English author and IT consultant, predicted a shortage of tech skills in the 1980s in his book <em>Application Development Without Programmers</em>. He postulated computers will eventually have to be used without programmers.</p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">Around the time of his prediction, the first version of Excel—a low code tool, was released. Excel popularized the concept of analyzing data without writing code and became a standard data analysis tool in various industries.</p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have further enhanced no code business intelligence tools, enabling users with zero technical experience to analyze data by conversing in natural language. Interestingly, <a href="https://visionpoint.systems/statistic/by-2025-low-code-or-no-code-system-will-be-used-to-develop-70-of-businesses-application/" class="text-indigo-600">more than one-third of no code users are technical professionals</a> who use these tools to boost efficiency. </p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">More businesses are embracing no code business intelligence software because it offers several benefits, which include; </p>
<h3
  class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl"
>
  Democratizing Data
</h3>
<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">AI business intelligence tools democratize data analysis, visualization, and reporting. These tools enable diverse team members, regardless of their technical skills, to access, analyze, and interpret data effectively. </p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">A user-friendly interface with pre-built and customizable templates makes exploring and interacting with data easy for everyone. This inclusiveness eliminates technical barriers and encourages independent data-driven decisions.</p>
<h3
  class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl"
>
  Empowers Employees
</h3>
<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">When employees have easy access to data and can independently generate insights, they develop a deeper sense of belonging within the team. This enhanced accessibility fosters greater collaboration, improves decision-making, and encourages collective problem-solving.</p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">As employees interact more with data, they become inclined to develop analytical skills by seeking additional knowledge. Soon, they take on more complex tasks and contribute meaningfully to their teams and organizations.</p>
<h3
  class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl"
>
  Drives Smarter Decisions and Greater Impact
</h3>
<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">Some of the most successful companies leverage data to their advantage in decision-making. Imagine the impact if everyone in your company became a data champion. </p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">Each employee's decisions influence the entire organization. Poor decisions can set the business back significantly, causing a loss of competitive advantage, while the right decisions can provide a substantial boost to the bottom line.</p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">With AI-powered business intelligence tools, each department can become more data-driven by conducting their analyses independently, without relying on the data team. These tools provide accurate analyses, enabling technical and non-technical staff to make impactful contributions, thus improving business outcomes.</p>
<h3
  class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl"
>
  Saves Cost 
</h3>
<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">The traditional method of hiring more talent to tackle the growing list of tasks in the data analyst backlog leads to an inflated employee roster. Also, the high demand for skilled professionals who can write code makes this approach expensive.</p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">Integrating AI business intelligence tools into your business eliminates the need for a large team of data analysts or third-party consultants, significantly reducing associated costs. Additionally, it minimizes expenses related to fixing bugs and regular maintenance.</p>
<h3
  class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl"
>
  Easy to Integrate and Navigate
</h3>
<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">Most no code business intelligence platforms can connect to various databases for real-time analysis. Their built-in connectors support multiple data storage platforms that automatically sync when changes are made to the database.</p>

<figure class="mt-8 mb-16">
  <img class="bg-gray-50" src="../images/cms-323159supported_databases.png" alt="Supported databases" />
</figure>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">Non-technical users can seamlessly navigate the platforms, generate reports, create dashboards, and perform other tasks without tutorials or external interventions.</p>
<h3
  class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 sm:text-2xl"
>
  Reduces Bottlenecks
</h3>
<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">The typical timeframe to turn business questions into data-driven decisions takes about 2-6  months. In addition, only individuals with technical skills are privy to handling data, and so the process is subject to their prerogative.</p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">Integrating no code BI tools, such as BlazeSQL, into your business helps to reduce bottlenecks. As the business grows and more data is collected, scaling is easy because there will be no need for time-consuming refactoring or system overhauls.</p>

<p class="mt-3 text-xl leading-8">BlazeSQL is a no-code tool that connects seamlessly with various SQL databases. Once your database is connected, you can ask Blaze, our AI chatbot, for insights within your data. For instance, you might say, "Plot a bar graph of the top five selling products," and Blaze will generate the necessary insights without any coding required. With BlazeSQL, you can effortlessly create BI dashboards, share insights with team members, send weekly email reports, and much more.</p>
